# nexmark-beam

Containerized Nexmark Beam with some additional customization.

The goal of this package is to be able to launch instances of Nexmark Beam in containerized environments such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm/Compose, for repeatable benchmarking purposes.

Additional features are planned such as the possibility to set custom parallelism for each group of operators.
